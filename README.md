**This repository currently exists for the sole purpose of allowing Stremio users to write issues they have with the add-on.**

The original repository with the code for this add-on was removed and the repository was remade to no longer give access to the code.

This was done on the request of the webmaster from [AnimeVibe.xyz](https://animevibe.xyz), who kindly gave free access to the website's API so this add-on could be built.

The webmaster requested this as the website suffered after a DDOS attack, that might or might not have been related to the open sourcing of this add-on as others attempted to brute force their way into the API.

We thank him, for his generosity and wish him luck and perseverence in hopes such attacks stop.

For further information on the AnimeVibe API, please contact Doflamingo on the AnimeVibe discord server.
